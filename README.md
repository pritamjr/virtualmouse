# virtualmouse
This code creates a virtual mouse control system that allows you to move the mouse cursor and perform clicks by tracking the movements of your hand, specifically the index finger and thumb, in front of the camera. It uses the OpenCV and Mediapipe libraries for hand detection and gesture recognition and the PyAutoGUI library for controlling the mouse.
